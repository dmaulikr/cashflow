What's new in ver 5.0

Note:
With this version, login method for Dropbox was changed.
If you install the official Dropbox application, CashFlow
uses it for login, or web browser is used.

before version up.

If you can't login dropbox with cashflow, select "unlink dropbox
account" in "config" section of cashflow.
